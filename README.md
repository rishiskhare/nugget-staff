# Nugget Staff Website

During my sophomore year of high school, an editor-in-chief for the school's yearbook committee reached out to me to develop a static webpage for them. The site follows a scrollable one-page format, and is responsive to screen resizing.

Note: The design was adapted from a template I found online at the time, though as of writing this README, I can't find the template (possibly removed). If you know the original designer, feel free to email me at rishiskhare@gmail.com.
